        <h2> Recepie Steps</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li> <strong> Brown the oxtails: </strong> Pat dry oxtails with paper towels. Sprinkle oxtails all over with salt and pepper. 
                Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil on medium to medium high heat in a 6-quart Dutch oven.Working in batches, and not crowding the pan, 
                sear the oxtails in hot pan on all sides until golden brown. Use tongs to remove oxtails to a plate, setting aside. </li>

            <li> <strong> Sauté onions, carrots, celery: </strong> Add the chopped onion, carrot, and celery to the pan. Cook for a few minutes until onions are translucent. </li>

            <li> <strong> Add oxtails, garlic, bay leaf, thyme, salt, stock, wine, then simmer: </strong> Add the oxtails back to the pan. 
                Add the whole garlic cloves, the stock and wine. Add bay leaf, thyme, and half a teaspoon of salt. Bring to simmer. 
                Reduce heat to low. Cover and cook for 3 hours, until meat is fork tender. </li>

            <li> <strong> Roast root vegetables: </strong> One hour before the meat is done, heat oven to 350°F (175°C). 
                Toss carrots, parsnips, and turnips in olive oil in a roasting pan. Sprinkle well with salt and pepper.
                Roast vegetables for 1 hour, or until lightly browned and cooked through. </li>

            <li> <strong> Skim fat: </strong> When meat is tender, remove oxtails from the cooking liquid. Either skim the fat off the top with a spoon, 
                use a fat separator to remove the fat, or chill the cooking liquid for several hours so that the fat solidifies, making it easier to remove.
                If you are making ahead, at this point you can just put the stew in the refrigerator (let come to room temp first), with the oxtails still in it, 
                and let it chill over night. The next day, scrape off the fat, reheat and then remove the meat from the dish.</li>
            
                <li> <strong> Strain solids from cooking liquid, reduce liquid: </strong> Pour the cooking liquid through a mesh strainer into a bowl, 
                    using a rubber spatula to press against the vegetable solids caught in the strainer. Discard the solids. 
                    Return the liquid to the pan and simmer until reduced by half.</li>

                <li> <strong> Add back oxtails, roasted vegetables: </strong> Then add back in the oxtails, and add the roasted vegetables to the pan. 
                    Heat on low heat for half an hour for the flavors to meld. Add some chopped parsley before serving. </li>
                
                    <li> <strong> You're Done! </strong> Enjoy the falvors of the carribean! :) </li>
