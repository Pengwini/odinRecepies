        <h3>Description</h3>
        If you love Indian food you have to try this recipe! This Chicken Curry tastes just as good as what you’d get at an Indian restaurant, if not better, and it’s easy to make.
        it's brimming with flavor thanks to all the spices, it’s rich and creamy and it’s amazingly hearty when you finish it off with basmati rice or naan bread.
